# Course Promo Video

* NOTE: In 2022, we are rebranding as a company. As part of this effort, from February 2022, we are attempting to 'unbrand' as much as possible. This means we will not mention raywenderlich.com in our videos & this includes the promo video. Please take note of this when writing your promo script. The ending sentence of the promo will change from 'This course is available now on raywenderlich.com' to 'This course is available now'.

For each course we make or update on our site, we create a special promotional video to help spread the word about your new course.

Promo videos should follow this structure:

1. **Describe a problem** the target student has likely encountered.
2. **Show the solution** - your course - and what the student will be able to do by the end.
3. **Give a few details** by listing the course highlights.
4. **Call to action.**

See sample scripts below!

## Script

*Add your promo script to this file, replacing the template below!* 

*Feel free to tweak the template to better suit your course and speaking style, as long as you follow the 4 steps listed above. But do NOT change the ending sentence! And remember that for most of the promo, you will not be visible on screen (voice only!) so avoid joking comments or statments that require your facial expressions/body language to be visible.*

Have you ever wanted to add authentication to your Flutter apps, but found it a rather long and complicated process? Or have you tried to store your apps' data in the cloud? 

Follow along with my course to discover how FlutterFire can help you easily add back-end features to your apps, including dealing with authentication, storing files and data, and even receive notifications!

By building an app that tracks your sport activities, you’ll learn how to authenticate with your email and password, read and write data into a cloud database, upload pictures from your device's gallery, and receive notifications, all leveraging FlutterFire. 

This course is available now.

**Please note:** that the final sentence will match up with a premade animation, so do not change the wording of that sentence. And do not add any sentences after it - if you want to add additional information, do it before you say, "This course is available now.")

**When recording, note** that you'll be on screen for the entire first bit of the promo until after you say, "Complete my course" so we need everything before that to be done in a clean take. 
If you mess up and have to repeat a sentence during the beginning part, do the whole beginning bit over until you can get it in a clean take.

## Demo Footage

During the “Complete my course” section, we want to show two types of footage (with your voice in the background).

Please specify the video segments you want to use for each type, using timestamps from your unedited demo recordings
(Record footage specially for the promo video, if you need to.): 

* **Demo:** [TODO: A final product demo. For example, the final app of your course if it looks cool, otherwise some other motivating final result.]
* **Code:** [TODO: Typing some code or working in your IDE.]


## Sample Promo Video Scripts

**Sample1**

Have you ever wanted your app to be notified when a user enters a particular location or have you ever wanted to incorporate maps into your app?

This video course, for intermediate iOS developers, teaches you to leverage the power of Core Location and MapKit to show your users where they are, and help them get to where they are going.

You’ll learn about Core Location's permission system and how to use Core Location to monitor regions, provide driving directions, and even how convert street addresses to latitude and longitude or vice versa. 
You'll also learn how to incorporate maps into your app, how to annotate them, and even how to replace the map with your own custom renderings to create unique experiences.

This course is available now.

**Sample 2**

Are you tired of your app code being stuck in Activity and Fragment classes and mashed up with the app lifecycle? Using an architecture pattern like Model-View-Presenter (or MVP for short) allows you to separate your app's code in a coherent way.

Complete my course and you’ll be able to use MVP to structure your app code into classes that are easier to test and maintain, keeping your presentation and business logic separate from your user interface.

You’ll learn about presenters, repositories, testing, LiveData, and much more.

This course is available now.

**Sample 3**

Are you a self-taught developer, like me, who never studied computer science at school?  Or maybe you're preparing for a round of upcoming programming interviews?

If you've never built your own data structures or written custom sorting algorithms before, our Data Structures and Algorithms course can help you get started.

Follow along with our new course to learn fundamental data structures like queues and binary trees, and implement essential sorting algorithms like Merge Sort.

If you're looking to brush up on your skills, we also build up to more advanced topics like graph data structures and Dijkstra's algorithm.

This course is available now.

Demo Footage:

* Demo: Use any footage of the ship sailing around, and the part where I label the stacks "enqueue" and "dequeue".
* Code: DSA - Demo - 3-08-2: start at 0:40, however long you need it to be is fine.
